Introduction

1. It is an institute level bicycle sharing system which calculates the requirement of cycles at each hub location based on institute time table.

2. We can also consider other factors to decide these requirements like bus schedule, average attendance of each student in a class, average attendance of every class but because of time constraint I stick to the first parameter(institute time table) for calculating requirements.

3. After calculating requirements, distribute the available cycles to each hub according to requirements of that hub.

4. Admin can also manually set requirement of particular hub and this requirement affects the available cycles of that hub

5. Student can book a cycle from any of the hub location and drop it to any of the hub location

6. There are some constraints which I have not considered like what if student does not drop cycle but it just set in the application that he has dropped a cycles at some hub location.

7. Currently, it does not have large scale capability because i have taken only one parameter for calculating the requirements of each hub location but as I mentioned in second point that if we consider other important factors then we can get more accurate requirements at each hub location
